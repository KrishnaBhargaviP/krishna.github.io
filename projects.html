		<h2>Nepal Earthquake Assessment</h2>
		<article>
			<h2>Nepal Earthquake Assessment</h2>
			<p>In the aftermath of the devastating Nepal earthquake, I took on the challenge of assessing the impact of runoff from earthquake-triggered landslides. Utilizing image processing techniques and Python, I developed a standalone application tailored for our in-house project.
			</p>
			<p>By meticulously analyzing satellite imagery, I identified areas affected by landslides and provided crucial insights into the extent of the damage caused. My application enabled rapid assessment of the disaster's impact, aiding in relief efforts and strategic planning for rehabilitation.
			</p>
			<p>My solution played a pivotal role in post-disaster management, ensuring timely and effective responses by providing actionable information to authorities and relief organizations.

			<h2>Landfill Sites Optimum Usage Assessment</h2>
			<p>In my pursuit of sustainable waste management, I developed a solution to optimize landfill site usage through drone image processing. Using advanced techniques, I estimated the optimum usage of existing landfill sites and determined if there was a need for new sites.
			</p>
			<p>By analyzing drone-captured images, I gained insights into the current status of landfill sites and proposed strategies for optimization. My findings helped local authorities manage waste effectively and promoted environmental conservation efforts.
			</p>
			<p>By maximizing the usage of existing sites and minimizing the need for new ones, I contributed to sustainable practices in waste management, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment.

		<h2>Evapotranspiration Estimation</h2>
		<article>
			<h2>Evapotranspiration Estimation</h2>
			<p>To monitor environmental changes, I focused on estimating evapotranspiration for India. I developed an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, integrating data from various sources and producing near-real-time outputs using Pandas, NumPy, and GDAL.
			</p>
			<p>By processing vast amounts of data, I calculated evapotranspiration rates, providing valuable insights into water consumption by vegetation and soil. My solution empowered decision-makers with up-to-date information for water resource management and agricultural planning.
			</p>
			<p>My efforts contributed to sustainable water usage practices, ensuring the efficient allocation of this vital resource.

		<h2>Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection</h2>
		<article>
			<h2>Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection</h2>
			<p>In the challenging terrain of the Himalayan region in India, landslides pose significant risks. I developed a semi-automatic landslide detection system using eCognition to address this challenge.
			</p>
			<p>By analyzing satellite imagery, I identified potential landslide areas with high accuracy, automating the detection process. My system enhanced landslide monitoring capabilities and facilitated early warning systems, mitigating risks to lives and property.
			</p>
			<p>By leveraging technology to tackle this natural hazard, I contributed to enhancing disaster resilience in vulnerable regions.
			</p>
			<p>In conclusion, my expertise in image processing, data analysis, and software development has enabled me to tackle complex challenges across various domains. I am committed to leveraging technology for the greater good, driving positive change, and making a meaningful impact on society and the environment.
